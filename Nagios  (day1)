Nagios is an open-source monitoring tool that helps you keep an eye on your infrastructure. It monitors hosts (like servers), services (like HTTP, SSH, MySQL), and resources (like CPU, disk, memory). It alerts you when things go wrong and notifies you when they recover.

ðŸ”§ Components of Nagios

Nagios Core: The main engine, web interface + backend

Plugins: Small scripts to check services (e.g., check_http, check_ping)

NRPE (Nagios Remote Plugin Executor): Used to run plugins on remote Linux machines

ðŸ›  REAL WORLD WORKFLOW

The Nagios scheduler decides when to run checks (e.g., check web server every 5 minutes).

The plugin is run either:

Locally (e.g., ping to Google)

Remotely using NRPE/SSH (e.g., check_disk on another server)

The result is processed by Nagios Core:

If status = OK â†’ no action

If status = WARNING or CRITICAL â†’ notify via email/SMS/slack

The result is displayed on the Web UI for admins to view.

ðŸ’¼ REAL WORLD EXAMPLE

Imagine youâ€™re in charge of a company with 30 Linux servers:

Nagios is installed on 1 central server.

Each of the 30 servers has NRPE + plugins installed.

You configure Nagios to monitor:

Disk space, CPU, RAM

Services like MySQL, Apache

Network status via ping

If one serverâ€™s disk hits 95%, Nagios shows a red alert and sends an email to the sysadmin team.

ðŸ“Œ Summary

Nagios lets you watch your entire infrastructure from one dashboard. It uses plugins and protocols like NRPE to check internal metrics and alerts you when something breaks.
